# Battleship
A working game of battleship, in which the user plays an enemy AI, using cumulative material over the Procedural Programming semester.
Displays random battleship coordinates in quick succession to make the illusion that the computer/enemy is thinking about which coordinate to shoot at.
After the function returns the last random coordinate is still on the screen, but the cursor is back up so that it can be overwritten with something new.
