# Network File Share
This program creates a UDP server side and client side terminal able to send or receive *.txt* files over the same network. By sending the file over from the server side, it sends and outputs individual strings and stitches them together in a new document on the client side named the same thing. It will not work if the document doesnâ€™t exist or is not a *.txt* file.
