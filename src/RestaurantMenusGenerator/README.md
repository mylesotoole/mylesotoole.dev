# Restaurant Menus Generator
This program represents a restaurant ordering service and allows a user to select a restaurant and create a mock order. Previous reviews can be printed from a text file of the selected restaurant or the user can go straight to the menu. The menu will then be printed from a text file based on the selection. The user can then choose items to be added to their order. Once the user is finished with their order, the userâ€™s itemized receipt will be printed based on everything they have selected. Then the user can add a tip (in percentage) and pay with a card. The order total plus tax and tip will be printed for the user. The user will then have the option to review the selected restaurant and add a rating. If the user decides to add a review, then the review will be stored in a text file so it can be viewed by other users.
